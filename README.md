# Tableau dashboards and data visualizations
This repository contains various data visualizations I have created using Tableau, including some that I have posted to Tableau Public. 

The visualiations incldue bubble plots comparing U.S. Median home price data vs the Affordability Index for 2018 at the Metropolitan Area.

Other plots in the repo include a histogram using the Ames, IA housing dataset.
